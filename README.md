# Players-detection
 Players detection and tracking using OpenCV. Application uses OpenCV tracking algorithms to track players on some playground in video. Application need image of background and video record. In GUI can be set some parameters for better results and chose tracking algorithm. Background subtraction is based on difference between reference background image without players. Video record must be static.
 * Note: Application NOT already done. This is only demo. GUI is not optimalized and struct of code is not very well but base function is working.

 ## GUI:
 * Qt 6
 
 ## Requirements:
 * OpenCV 4.4.2
 * Qt 6

 ## Run:
 * Visual Studion 2019
 In this project OpenCV is in PATH.
